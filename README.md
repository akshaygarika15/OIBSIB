##Data Science Internship Projects
Welcome to my repository showcasing the various data science projects I completed during my internship at Oaias Infobit. Each project demonstrates my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. Below is a brief overview of each project:

#1. Car Price Prediction
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various features such as mileage, brand, model year, and more. I utilized regression techniques and performed feature engineering to enhance the model's predictive performance. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model selection, and evaluation.

###Key Techniques Used:

Regression algorithms
Feature engineering
Data preprocessing
Model evaluation

2. Email Spam Detection
The Email Spam Detection project focuses on building a classification model to identify and filter out spam emails from legitimate ones. I applied natural language processing techniques to preprocess the email content and used classification algorithms to create an effective spam detection system.

Key Techniques Used:
Natural language processing
Text preprocessing
Feature extraction
Classification algorithms

##3. IRIS Flower Classification
In this classification project, I worked with the classic IRIS dataset to classify different species of IRIS flowers based on their sepal and petal characteristics. I explored various machine learning algorithms, fine-tuned their parameters, and created a model that accurately predicts the species of an IRIS flower.

Key Techniques Used:
Classification algorithms
Model selection
Parameter tuning
Data visualization


##4. Unemployment Analysis
The Unemployment Analysis project involved analyzing unemployment trends and factors affecting unemployment rates. I collected relevant economic data, performed exploratory data analysis, and visualized trends over time. The project provides insights into the relationships between different economic indicators and unemployment rates.

##Key Techniques Used:
Exploratory data analysis
Time series analysis
Data visualization
Correlation analysis
